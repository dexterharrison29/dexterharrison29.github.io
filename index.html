    <div class="content"><h2>This site is really just a mix of two things I like doing; Programming and Writing. I'm not sure if you can tell, but im actually horrible at html/css/javascript. It will get better over time, i promise. This page is what the layout of the blog will look like(at first); I know its an eyesore, but im proud of it as someone who knows 0 html and css. I will gladly accept suggestions on my <a href="https://github.com/dexterharrison29/dexterharrison29.github.io/issues">github page</a>(use the default enhancement label). Thanks for reading, and come back shortly because ill have something posted soon. I'm using dark-mode for the site because I personally like it better.</h2></div>
