        When you think of programming geniuses, you might think of folks like Mark Zuckerburg, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs(or Steve Wozniak), maybe even Larry Page; and if you are one of THOSE people you might even list Satoshi Nakamoto, an anonymous alias used by a single programmer or a group of programmers. While those are certainly the more successful ones, this article is not about them. This is about a programmer who was brilliant by every metric available. Who, if not for mental illness, might have been considered among the names I just listed. But he isn’t, due to a plethora of reasons i’m about to get into; This article is about, as the name suggests, The Tragedy of Terry Davis.

      <h2>
        Terry Davis was born in a suburb of Milwaukee called West Allis. He was the seventh child in a family of 8. As a child, he was exposed to the Apple II at his elementary school, which was one of the first commercial personal computers. As a teenager, he learned assembly on a commodore 64, which still stands today as the most sold computer of all time. You should remember the commodore 64(which from now on I will simply refer to as the C64) because it holds later significance. In 1994 at the age of 24 he got his masters degree in electrical engineering from Arizona State, and shortly thereafter got a job at ticketmaster where he programmed VAX machines. Despite growing up catholic, he became an atheist for a short period in his adult years, quickly switching back due to a “spiritual awakening” as described by him. It's unknown the reasoning behind it, but in 1996 he became seriously mentally ill and was admitted to psychiatric wards every 6 months, due to extreme manic episodes. His delusions were mostly centered around space aliens and government agents. Shortly thereafter, he started donating large sums of money to charitable organizations, which he credits as the reason God allegedly opened up to him. He believed that God chose him alone to make God’s third temple… in code. At first, Temple OS started as “J operating system” in 2003, with its first release being in 2005. It’s unknown if it was dedicated to god at this point or simply a personal project that slowly warped into a project dedicated to god(although it's most certainly the latter). He eventually went through several more names, such as LoseThos and SparrowOS before settling on the final name, TempleOS. The software was written in a language that is a mix of C and C++, initially called C+, although later renamed to HolyC(likely as a play on the Holy See, the official jurisdiction of the Vatican). It had zero networking support, which his initial reasoning for was due to “not wanting to reinvent the wheel” although he later claimed that the reason he didn’t implement it was because templeOS is a holy creation and the purpose is to connect with god, not the outside world. A few weeks later after renaming his project to TempleOS, he announced something on his website: “God's temple is finished. Now, God kills CIA until it spreads”. Besides TempleOS, Davis loved to drum. At first, he drummed using his lap or mini drums, which were very quiet. However, someone on 4chan bought him a drum set because of his passion. Unfortunately, he would get kicked out because of the noise he generated(without the drumset) and would make videos on the streets until he tragically got hit by a train on August 11th, 2018.
